      The Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP in the European
      Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment,
      environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute
      to its status as one of the world's major global cities. Madrid is home to
      two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. Due to
      its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is
      considered the major financial centre and the leading economic hub of the
      Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe. It hosts the head offices of the
      vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as Telefónica, IAG or
      Repsol. Madrid is also the 10th most liveable city in the world according
      to Monocle magazine, in its 2017 index.
