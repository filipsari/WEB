    <h1>Madrid</h1>

    <p class="first-p">
      Madrid is the capital and most-populous city of Spain. The city has almost
      3.4 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of
      approximately 6.7 million. It is the second-largest city in the European
      Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin, and its monocentric metropolitan
      area is the second-largest in the EU, surpassed only by Paris.[9][10][11]
      The municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi) geographical area.[12]
      Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the center of both the country and
      the Community of Madrid region, of which it is also the capital. As the
      capital city of Spain, seat of government, residence of the Spanish
      monarch, Madrid is also the political, economic and cultural centre of the
      country.[13] The mayor is José Luis Martínez-Almeida from the People's
      Party.

    <p class="second-p">
      The Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP in the European
      Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment,
      environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute
      to its status as one of the world's major global cities. Madrid is home to
      two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. Due to
      its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is
      considered the major financial centre and the leading economic hub of the
      Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe. It hosts the head offices of the
      vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as Telefónica, IAG or
      Repsol. Madrid is also the 10th most liveable city in the world according
      to Monocle magazine, in its 2017 index.

      (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization
      of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board
      (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the
      Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish
      Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the
      Instituto Cervantes and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fundéu BBVA).
      Madrid organises fairs such as FITUR,[21] ARCO,[22] SIMO TCI[23] and the
