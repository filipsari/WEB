    <h1>Madrid</h1>

    <p class="first-p">
      <span> 	&#34;Madrid is the capital and most-populous city of Spain.</span>  	&#34; The
      city has almost 3.4 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population
      of approximately 6.7 million. It is the second-largest city in the
      European Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin, and its monocentric
      metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU, surpassed only by
      Paris.[9][10][11] The municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi)
      geographical area.[12] Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the center
      of both the country and the Community of Madrid region, of which it is
      also the capital. As the capital city of Spain, seat of government,
      residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political, economic
      and cultural centre of the country.[13] The mayor is José Luis
      Martínez-Almeida from the People's Party.

    <p class="second-p">
      The Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP in the European
      Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment,
      environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute
      to its status as one of the world's major global cities.
      <span 	&#34;
        >Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and
        Atlético Madrid. 	&#34;
      </span>
      Due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size,
      Madrid is considered the major financial centre and the leading economic
      hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe. It hosts the head
      offices of the vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as
      Telefónica, IAG or Repsol. Madrid is also the 10th most liveable city in
      the world according to Monocle magazine, in its 2017 index.

        Madrid houses the headquarters of the UN's World Tourism Organization 	&#34;
      </span>
      (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization
      of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board
      (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the
      Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish
      Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the
      Instituto Cervantes and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fundéu BBVA).

      While Madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look
      and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets.

        Its landmarks include the Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace of Madrid; the
        Royal Theatre with its restored 1850 Opera House; the Buen Retiro Park,
        founded in 1631; 	&#34;

      Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising
      three art museums: Prado Museum, the Reina Sofía Museum, a museum of
      modern art, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which complements the
      holdings of the other two museums.[26] Cibeles Palace and Fountain has
